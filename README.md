## How to play scrub letter

Shuffle the 16 cards to form a face-down draw deck. Remove the top card of the deck from the game without looking at it.
If you are playing a two-player game, take three more cards from the top of the deck and place them to the side, face up. They will not be used during this round.
Each player draws one card from the deck. Determine who goes first.

There are 16 cards total. Each card has a number or “value”. I’m going to list them as “value x  quantity” and then list their effect when discarded.

The round ends when there are no cards left or when only one person is left in the game. If only one person is left, they win the round. If there are no cards left, the person with the highest value card wins the round. In the case of a tie, the person who discarded the highest sum total value in cards wins.

A player wins the game after winning:
2 Players: 7 rounds
3 Players: 5 rounds
4 Players: 4 rounds.

In loot letter rounds are rounds and wins are loot. In love letter rounds are days and wins are.. favor? Really doesn't matter how it's themed.

1x5: Name a card with a value besides 1 and choose a player. If that player has that card, he or she is out of the round.
2x2: Look at another player's hand.
3x2: You and another player secretly compare hands. The player with the lower value is out of the round.
4x2: Until your next turn, ignore effects from all other players’ cards.
5x2: Choose any player (including yourself) to discard his or her hand and draw a new card.
6x1: Trade hands with a player of your choice. 
7x1. If you have this card and the 5 or 6 value card in your hand, you must discard this card.
8x1: If you discard this card you are out of the round. 

Everyone has access to a list of all the cards and how many there are. 

## musings

Ideally the names on the cards would reference other card names, not values, I just replaced names with values there to make it generic.
Ideally the same matchmaking as https://skribbl.io/. You put in a name and you can either enter a currently active private room by name, play with randos, or name a hosted private room. You could also make an account where you could make your own little themed love letter decks by uploading pictures and naming cards, maybe adding flavor text.
Thinking now about the potential of Horrible Public Games with Horrible Cards. Could avoid this by having a couple generic card sets. 
Chat would be cool, voice would be cooler but probably not necessary, could do it if it’s very easy I guess. Could defo make it so you just click on the card you want to discard, and it draws for you, but it may be better if you can drag a card off of the deck, place it yourself, etc. Make it feel more natural, you can pull a card off and wiggle it in circles or go “ooooooooooooh who am I gonna pick ooooooooooooooooooh” as you mouse over the other players.
